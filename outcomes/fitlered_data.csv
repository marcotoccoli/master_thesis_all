 gm/sommelier bobby domenick presented us with the entirety of panettone. as huge slices of panettone were served, chef adam leonti himself came out to serve a heaping spoonful of sabayone made from prosecco - certainly a nice touch.   and as expected, at the end of the meal we were presented with a take-home bag, replete with hand-painted menus and some almond coffee cake bites for the next day.   certainly come to vetri ristorante for the amazing tasting menu, but you'll find yourself returning for the unparalleled service. kudos to the entire staff!",1,24.0,1,4951,0.2915

(it was not busy at the time.) we waited about 15 minutes before our table became available. when we sat, our waitress took our drink orders and after bringing them back, took our food order. heres where my aforementioned pet peeve comes into play. as we were sitting, a table sat next to us, and their waitress promptly rattled off the nights specials, as well as what i thought i heard was important information about what i had ordered (steak frites). i heard the words ""unlimited steak,"" but i was like, ""this isn't applebees...that can't be right."" so, i dismissed it, slightly miffed that our waitress hadn't even bothered with the specials. the meals start to come out, and everything was very good. fresh mozzarella was good, my salad was delicious, and the artichokes and pasta fagiolli were getting good marks. but, then the entrees came, and things went a little south. my steak frites came, and my first remark was, ""man....that steak is small!"" (its like 4 ounces maybe), and it was under my ""medium"" and came ""medium rare."" (no biggie). the fries were way over salty. the misses's rigatoni and meatballs was like a kids sized portion, and had literally 2 small meatballs. there were maybe 10 rigatoni. it really was a small portion. and apparently, that is a thing with the pasta dishes because the other pasta dish, the pappardelle with lamb, was also woefully small. the 4th dish, the pesto pizza, actually looked yummy, but i heard nothing about it, so it must not have wowed. anyway, after finishing up my sliver of steak, a manager walks by and asks if i would like another steak. so it is true! thats right, everyone who doesn't know; when you order the steak frites at garces trading company, it is all you can eat. why the hell didn't our waitress tell us that?! so, the manager runs off to get me another steak for my unlimited steak frites that i had no idea about......and he must've gotten sidetracked, because it was literally 20 minutes before a piece of well (emphasis on well) done shoe leather was brought out to me. whats it take to cook a 4 oz steak to medium? 4 minutes? tops? ugh. by that point, everyone was well finished with their meals, so we just decided to pack it in. a bright spot for gtc was that the wine pours seemed to be decent.   i'm not sure if ""iron chef"" used to mean something and one point, and maybe its my fault for buying into the hype, but i really just expect top notch stuff from iron chef restaurants. i know they aren't back there cooking the food themselves, but the standards should still be the same, no? gordon ramsey would've thrown that well done steak at the chefs head and called him a donkey. i also get that amada is the flagship, but still, its got your name on the side; can i at least hear the specials?! it wasn't anything that you'd be upset that you went to, but at about $50 a person, you should expect a little more. i couldve taken $50 and ate till i collapsed at fogos!",1,27.0,1,3655,0.1688

(more on that to come).  we started at the handsome marble bar by quaffing a cherry stout along with a portion of deliciously grilled bread (""why don't we do this at home?""), then headed to our table with most of our choices ironed out.  to start, we encountered brussels sprouts tossed with a perfect melange of accompaniments, including house-made pancetta (a version of pork being nearly obligatory in most brussels presentations), roasted sunchokes, crispy sage, and sweet, firm chunks of granny smith apples.  we chose brussels and pork in different incarnations in selecting the uovo pizza, a magnificent medley of brussels sprout leaves, house-made guanciale, a secret (delectable) white sauce, fior di latte, and  the piece de resistance: a truffled farm egg, runny, earthy, and perfect for dipping or spreading onto every magical slice.   with our server's leadership, we closed the meal with beautifully-browned house-made (the ubiquitous adjective of the evening) gnocchi, sauteed with more of the same glorious pancetta and mixed with cubed roasted butternut squash and thyme.  the dish made for an ideal ending, although we did pore over the list of extravagant desserts with a wistful thought about our next time.",1,63.0,1,2143,0.2669

(god, that sounds pretentious, but i don't mean it that way!) he still didn't tell us that the steak frites was all you can eat, but it didn't bother me this time, as he obviously knew that i knew that, based on the last review! i ordered a charcuterie plate and a rum punch to start and then we placed our entrée orders; branzino for the misses and scallop risotto for myself. charcuterie came out and was delicious. even the misses, whos needle pegs more ""anti meat"" happily devoured the slices of speck and prosciutto. rum punch is always a winner so we were off to high marks from the start. in between courses, our table was wiped and our silverware was replaced; little details that were neglected last time, causing the misses to remark, ""i see we're getting the vip treatment this time."" it did make me wonder though; is this standard procedure at gtc and we just didn't receive it last time, or were we getting a little something extra? either way, i appreciated the effort. about this time, the manager danelle, stopped by and introduced herself and made sure everything was ok. entrees came out and this is where gtc failed to grab that 5th star. we purposely avoided the pasta dishes, as the last time we dined here, the portions were tiny. but it appears that modest portions is just a thing they do at gtc. i guess its just a very european thing to do and the american in me expects larger portions. it honestly didn't bother me this time, but i still think its worth pointing out. either way, the entrees were plated beautifully, and the kitchen even honored the misses request to have the skin taken off of her branzino. both entrees were good, but i couldn't finish my scallop risotto, as i found it super salty. the chefs at gtc seem to have a heavy hand with the salt, as this was one of the dings against them the last time i was there. the misses didn't mind it, and we actually wound up switching entrees halfway through, so it all worked out. after dinner service, the waiter brought over the dessert menus, with his 2 suggestions; the winter verrine, and the bouchons. the desserts were fantastic. the misses happily broke her diet to devour almost the entire verrine (i jabbed a spoonful before it disappeared!) after a few cups of tea, our waiter told us everything was taken care of, and to have a nice night.  i was blown away by the hospitality and generosity of gtc and the manager danelle. they didn't have to offer me a gratis second go round, but its clear they value the garces brand and that it keep a sterling reputation. like i said, my first experience wasn't even bad, but gtc and danelle didn't want me to have a ""not bad"" experience, they wanted me to have a ""great"" one. although it still fell a tiny bit short, it wasn't for lack of effort, and i totally, totally appreciate it. if this is how you're supposed to get treated everytime at gtc, i wholeheartedly recommend it.",1,27.0,1,3888,0.1328

(i think this is a theme in my life: eat well. eat better if someone else is buying.) also, you should only share tapas with someone you don't mind, well, sharing plates with. utensils even. no room for finicky germ-fearing manners in these places.   we shared the sheeps milk ricotta, which was really thick, but still spread like a buttery dream. flavor was good but overall ricotta doesn't have much punch so i think i put some of the accompanying sea salt on it (i know, crucify me now, but they put it there so i must not be the only one).   we also had a platter of steak strips, but i don't remember the title of the dish. that was somewhat dry but still flavorful from herbs. not my favorite - wouldn't get it again.   the salted caramel budino needs no additional praise from me, what everyone else has said about it already is true. it's to die for.   what i remember most about this meal was the pizza. i don't remember which incarnation it was, but i do remember it arrived at the table with a small glass vial containing a few buds of a dried green leaf-like substance. i pretty much started breaking a sweat. i mean, i knew that philadelphia had recently decriminalized this, but were they offering it as a topping on pizza already? could i proceed through dinner after eating this and remain coherent? what? it's rosemary. shoot. nevermind.  and on that note, my final word of advice: read the menu online before you go down here in order to look up whatever ingredients you don't recognize or words you don't understand. you will look cool if you can tell people what they mean, as a result, and it will spare you pulling out your cell phone to do the same thing at the table instead.",0,63.0,1,2512,0.1103
